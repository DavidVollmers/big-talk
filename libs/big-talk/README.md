# 🦜 BigTalk

> The lightweight, middleware-first LLM framework for Python.

BigTalk is designed for developers who want the power of agents (tool calling, loops, memory) without the bloat of
heavy frameworks. It provides a clean, type-safe abstraction over LLMs with a robust middleware pipeline inspired by
Starlette/FastAPI.

## Installation

```bash
pip install big-talk-ai[anthropic]
